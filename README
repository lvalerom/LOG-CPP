Is getting a little messy...

Dependencies:

boost 1.59.0 for the old project
boost 1.61.0 for the new project
cmake 3.6 for the new project

This project is just a simple set of "cross platform" log libraries. Right now there are two main projects:

The old one is configured with autotools for Linux and Visual Studio for Windows.

To setup the autotools project you have to download the ax_boost_*.m4 macros and place them in the m4 directory (at the same level as autogen.sh script). Then run:

./autogen.sh ; cd bin ; ../configure ; make

To setup the Visual Studio project [TODO]

The newest project is the cmake project. To setup this one you have to run:

cd bin ;  cmake .. ; make
